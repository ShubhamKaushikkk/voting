        India is a Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic and the largest
        democracy in the World. The modern Indian nation state came into
        existence on 15th of August 1947. Since then free and fair elections
        have been held at regular intervals as per the principles enshrined in
        the Constitution, Electoral Laws and System.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Constitution of India has vested in the Election Commission of India
        the superintendence, direction and control of the entire process for
        conduct of elections to Parliament and Legislature of every State and to
        the offices of President and Vice-President of India.

        Election Commission of India is a permanent Constitutional Body. The
        Election Commission was established in accordance with the Constitution
        on 25th January 1950. The Commission celebrated its Golden Jubilee in
        2001.
        <br />
        <br />
        Originally the commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. It
        currently consists of Chief Election Commissioner and two Election
        Commissioners. For the first time two additional Commissioners were
        appointed on 16th October 1989 but they had a very short tenure till 1st
        January 1990. Later, on 1st October 1993 two additional Election
        Commissioners were appointed. The concept of multi-member Commission has
        been in operation since then, with decision making power by majority
        vote.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Commission has a separate Secretariat at New Delhi, consisting of
        about 300 officials, in a hierarchical set up.
